I'm an PhD candidate under the supervision of Professor [Jun Liu](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/j-liu) and Professor [Steven Wang](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/stevenwang.htm) at the 
[Centre for Robotics and Automation](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cra/) of [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). 
Additionally, I collaborate with Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/), Prof. [Jianqin Yin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianqin-Yin) and Prof. [Zhuoran Zhang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhangzhuoran).
Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the
[South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I worked with Professor
[Zhenping Wan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=it9ogjMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on applying deep learning to improve medical imaging and robotic surgical precision. 
I am particularly interested in real-time image analysis to enhance medical interventions. 
To address hardware limitations, I design lightweight neural networks that reduce computational demands, making advanced AI more accessible in resource-constrained settings. 
My work includes developing non-invasive sperm detection frameworks for in vitro fertilization.
Additionally, I work with foundation models, using a variety of prompts to conduct precise analyses of medical objects.
