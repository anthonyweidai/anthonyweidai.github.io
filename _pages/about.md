I'm an PhD candidate under the supervision of Professor [Jun Liu](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/j-liu) and Professor [Steven Wang](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/stevenwang.htm) at the 
[Centre for Robotics and Automation](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cra/) of [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/). 
<!-- and [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/) of [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/) -->
Additionally, I collaborate with Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/), Prof. [Jianqin Yin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianqin-Yin) and Prof. [Zhuoran Zhang](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/zhangzhuoran).
I am also affiliated with the 
[Automation & Intelligent Robot Lab (AIRLab)](https://airlab.hku.hk/team).
Previously, I received my B.Eng. in
[Mechanical Engineering](http://cogsci.ucmerced.edu/) from the
[South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I worked with Professor
[Zhenping Wan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhenping-Wan).

My Research interests lie at the intersection medical image analysis, computer vision, and deep learning.
My goal is to develop innovative and intelligent systems that facilitate efficient and high-quality medical diagnoses and interventions. 
Recently, my focus has been on analysing small medical objects to aid in the early diagnosis of diseases.
I am also intrigued by label-efficient deep learning solutions, such as data augmentation in self-supervised learning and domain adaptation, to create reliable and effective intelligent systems.
