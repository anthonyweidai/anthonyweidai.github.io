I received my Ph.D. from [CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), where I work with Prof. [Jun Liu](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/j-liu), Prof. [Yixuan Yuan](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~yxyuan/), and Prof. [Zhuoran Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=deJNhn4AAAAJ&hl=en).
Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), where I worked with Professor [Zhenping Wan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=it9ogjMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on applying deep learning to improve medical imaging and robotic surgical precision. 
I am particularly interested in foundation models and use multimodal inputs to systematically analyse medical subjects.
My work includes developing non-invasive sperm detection frameworks for in vitro fertilization.
Additionally, I work with real-time image analysis to enhance medical interventions. 
To address hardware limitations, I design lightweight neural networks that reduce computational demands, making advanced AI more accessible in resource-constrained settings. 

**I am currently exploring opportunities in the academic job market for faculty positions or postdoctoral roles.**
